## What was the goal of this project?
- The goal of this project was to take user input and create a logo in the form of an svg file. I achieved this by asking the user a series of prompts gathering info on the following 4 things... text, text color, shape, and shape color. Once the user goes through the prompts it then takes that information and creates a logo like the one listed below. 

## Installation
- This is ran through the integrated terminal using node and is triggered by typing in the following command, `"node index"` as long as your in the project folder.

## Usage 
- Used to create a small svg logo in the form of a shape with 3 characters in the middle of it.

## Tests
- Ran mutiple tests using `"jest"` to see that the shapes are working properly.
